          Impossible Beef is made from plants for people who love meat. Anything
          you can make with ground beef, you can make with Impossible Beef Made
          From Plants-tacos, sliders, lasagna, you name it! It's packed with
          protein and nutrients, has 0mg cholesterol (13g total fat, 6g
          saturated fat per serving), and is way better for the planet than beef
          from cows.
